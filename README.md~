This program is an introduction to ML. It has five basic functions.

1.) Cycle takes a list and an integer, and cycles the list i amount of times. It does so by putting the head of the list at the tail, and calling the function again.

2.) Dup duplicates each item in a list. It does so by isolating the first entry of the list, adding it twice to the rest of the list, and moving to the next entry.

3.) Removei removes a specified entry of a list.
